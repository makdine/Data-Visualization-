# Data-Visualization-

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

In the world of Big Data, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions.

Why is data visualization important?

Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data is easier than poring over spreadsheets or reports. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner â€“ and you can experiment with different scenarios by making slight adjustments.

Data visualization can also:

Identify areas that need attention or improvement.
Clarify which factors influence customer behavior.
Help you understand which products to place where.
Predict sales volumes.
